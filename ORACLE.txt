1). The procedure will get overwritten by this function
2). There will be a procedure as well as a function with the same name, addNumbers
3). Compilation error.  name is already used by an existing object
4). None of the above
Solution :
option [3] is correct

Q. Which of the statements are true about the following pl/sql block 
   DECLARE 
    V_STAFF_NO  NUMBER  := 600080'; 
    V_EMP_NAME VARCHAR2(10); 

 BEGIN 
      SELECT staff_name  FROM STAFF_MASTER  WHERE STAFF_CODE = V_STAFF_NO ;
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee name is ' || V_EMP_NAME); 

EXCEPTION 

WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN 
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No such employee: ' || Emp_number); 
WHEN Others
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('some exception'); 

END;

1). Will show compilation error because into clause is missing
2). Will print some exception message
3). Will run successfully
4). Will show a compilation error because V_EMP_NAME is not initialized
Solution :
option [1] is correct

Q. Assume that table ERRORS is having following structure:

Name             Null?          Type
-----------------------------------
Errorno                            Number
Errormess                        Char(100)

Identify the erroneous line in the given code snippet. (Refer the line numbers which are given in the snippet.)

 1DECLARE
 2 Err_Num NUMBER ;
 3 Err_Msg CHAR(100);
 4 BEGIN

 6 WHEN OTHERS THEN
 7 INSERT INTO errors VALUES (SQLCODE, SQLERRM);
 8 END;

1). line 2
2). line 6
3). line 7 
4). no error
Solution :
option [3] is correct

Q. PL/SQL raises an exception, in which TWO of the following cases

1). When a SELECT statement returns no rows 
2). When a SELECT statement returns more than one row 
3). When the datatypes of SELECT clause and INTO clause do not match 
4). When INTO statement is missing in the SELECT statement 
Solution :
option [1,2] are correct

Q. Observe the following code and predict the ouput 

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE PROC1(num1 NUMBER, num2 NUMBER) AS
result NUMBER;
BEGIN
result:=num1+num2;
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(result);
RETURN result;
END;
/

1). Compilation error as RETURN statement cannot contain an expression
2). Compilation succeeds and the value in result variable will be displayed
3). Compilation will succeed if only RETURN is written instead of RETURN result;
4). None of the above
Solution :
option [1,3] are correct

Q. Consider the following code and determine the correct code for calling this function 

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION addNumbers(num1 in out number, num2 number) RETURN
number as
BEGIN
num1:=num1+num2;
RETURN num1;
END;

1). BEGIN
addNumbers(10,20);
END;
2). DECLARE 
ans number;
BEGIN
ans:=addNumbers(10,20);
END;
3). declare
ans number;
num1 number:=10;
begin
ans:=addNumbers(num1,20);
end;
/
4). declare
ans number;
num1 number:=10;
num2 number:=20;
begin
ans:=addNumbers(num1,num2);
